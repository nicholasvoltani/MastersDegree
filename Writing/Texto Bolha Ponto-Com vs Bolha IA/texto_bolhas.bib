  abstract = {In this article, we present elements for a critique of the notion of a new data economy, often portrayed as a distinct stage in capitalist development, allegedly detached from the model of flexible accumulation characteristic of the finance-dominated phase of regulation. From a Marxist perspective, we argue that data should be understood as crude raw material, devoid of value. It is only when mobilised by labour that they are transformed into informational raw material, capable of being incorporated into different production processes -- as in the case of the audience-commodity -- or of presenting themselves as a commodity in their own right: the information-commodity. We also put forward the hypothesis that, when simply extracted and traded as promises of future use in productive processes, crude data configure a new form of fictitious accumulation. Finally, we reflect on the oligopolistic control exercised by the big techs, most of them based in the United States, over immense volumes of data, as well as on the implications this dominance bears for the sovereignty of peripheral countries.},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called ``dropout'' that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

It has almost invariably been seen as a market irrationality, a view fundamentally challenged by Bryer's theorisation of it as a deliberate and collusive device of the ``London wealthy'', aided by central government, to swindle provincial middle class investors. This analysis also greatly extended previous perspectives on the r\^ole of accounting by asserting that accounting practices were crucial to the success of the process and were thus ``deeply implicated'' in a great, class-based swindle. The acceptance of such a perspective would have important implications for the way we understand the functioning of accounting and capitalism in the mid-nineteenth century, but this paper instead argues that such notions are misconceived, looking to both the evidence that was available when Bryer's paper was written and to recently collected data on the depreciation accounting practices of the time.},

We find that fewer than 6\% of firms used any of the AI-related technologies we measure, though most very large firms reported at least some AI use. Weighted by employment, average adoption was just over 18\%. AI use in production, while varying considerably by industry, nevertheless was found in every sector of the economy and clustered with emerging technologies such as cloud computing and robotics. Among dynamic young firms, AI use was highest alongside moreeducated, more-experienced, and younger owners, including owners motivated by bringing new ideas to market or helping the community. AI adoption was also more common alongside indicators of high-growth entrepreneurship, including venture capital funding, recent product and process innovation, and growth-oriented business strategies. Early adoption was far from evenly distributed: a handful of ``superstar'' cities and emerging hubs led startups' adoption of AI. These patterns of early AI use foreshadow economic and social impacts far beyond this limited initial diffusion, with the possibility of a growing ``AI divide'' if early patterns persist.},

These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.},

  abstract = {This article revisits the so-called digital labour debate to clarify and problematise the many different positions in this debate. Synthesising the most promising arguments from the different positions in the debate, the article outlines a theory of digital media usage as exploited, value-producing labour. In doing so, the article criticises the Autonomist Marxist tradition and argues for the utility of a value-form theoretical approach to the question of free digital labour. In conclusion, the article argues for more analytical attention to the ways in which technological developments in contemporary capitalism can engender new processes of production and thereby also new types of unpaid value-producing labour.}
